					<h4>Anxiety Issues --</h4>
					<br/>
					<h5>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder - Post Traumatic Stress Disorder - Panic Attack - Phobias - Worry - Fear - Feeling on Edge</h5>
					<p>Anxiety has this incredible ability to show up in many shapes and forms. It might be an overwhelming sense of dread or gloom and doom, but not really knowing why you feel that way.It could appear as a panic attack when you might think you are dying or having a heart attack. Sometimes it surfaces in PTSD when you think you are right back in a traumatic situation. Anxiety might work its way in by having you obsess on the same thought over and over and over. Or it could simply be on going worry. Anxiety can make us feel like we are somehow crazy or out of control. The positive aspect of anxiety no matter how it might surface is, it is very treatable. Cognitive/behavioral therapy, insight oriented therapy, mindfulness therapy, hypnosis and EMDR can all be helpful with the treatment of anxiety and help an individual experience more joy without always feeling that other shoe is about to fall.</p>
